# DefectVision-AI-
AI-Powered Automated Defect Detection System

Overview
This project involves building an AI-powered defect detection system for manufacturing industries using MLOps, AutoML, Databricks (Apache Spark), GANs, and Computer Vision. The system will automate image-based quality inspection to detect defective products in real-time using deep learning models deployed via Django as a web dashboard.

Technology Stack
✅ MLOps – CI/CD for model training, monitoring, and deployment
✅ AutoML – Hyperparameter tuning and model selection
✅ Databricks (Apache Spark) – Scalable big data processing
✅ GANs – Synthetic data generation for training augmentation
✅ Computer Vision – Object detection & anomaly detection
✅ Django – Web framework for dashboard & API
✅ Docker & Kubernetes – Containerization & orchestration
✅ Azure/AWS/GCP – Cloud deployment

Key Features
🔹 Automated Image Processing – Detects product defects in real-time
🔹 GAN-based Data Augmentation – Generates synthetic images for training
🔹 AutoML for Model Optimization – Selects best-performing ML models
🔹 MLOps Pipeline – Automates model training, evaluation & deployment
🔹 Scalable Data Processing – Uses Databricks & Apache Spark for big data
🔹 Django Web Dashboard – Displays insights & defect classification

Implementation Plan
1️⃣ Data Collection & Preprocessing
📌 Gather images of defective vs. non-defective products
📌 Store data in Azure Data Lake / S3
📌 Preprocess using OpenCV & Spark

2️⃣ Data Augmentation with GANs
📌 Train a GAN model (e.g., StyleGAN, CycleGAN)
📌 Generate synthetic defective images for better training

3️⃣ Model Development & AutoML
📌 Use AutoML (H2O.ai, Google AutoML, or AutoKeras) for best defect detection model
📌 Train CNN-based Object Detection models (YOLO, Faster R-CNN)

4️⃣ MLOps Pipeline with Databricks
📌 Automate data ingestion, training, validation, and monitoring
📌 Deploy model via CI/CD (GitHub Actions, MLflow)
📌 Use Databricks MLflow for tracking experiments

5️⃣ Deployment & API Development
📌 Expose model via Django REST API
📌 Deploy via Docker & Kubernetes on Azure/AWS/GCP

6️⃣ Web Dashboard & Analytics
📌 Build Django-based UI to display defect insights
📌 Show real-time analytics & defect trends

Expected Outcome
✅ Faster & Automated Quality Inspection
✅ Scalable & Cloud-Ready AI Model
✅ Improved Defect Detection Accuracy
✅ Seamless Integration with Manufacturing Pipelines
